The GEO datasets were downloaded after initially searching for
influenza-specific data on NIAID ImmPort (via Immunespace.org).

We identified studies of interest from NIAID, given designations
of 'SDY' with a number. After downloading those individual files,
it was realized that the SDY files referenced GEO accession
numbers for each of the biosamples. Those have been downloaded
and reassigned names according to the following:

SDY640: Immunologic and genomic signatures of influenza vaccine
response - 2014
- DOI 10.21430/M3A6GYD5L0
- Year 5 of study; 37 subjects
- EXP14098 HAI Yr5 (280 samples)
